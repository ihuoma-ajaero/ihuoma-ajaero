## Hello, I'm Ihuoma.

I am a recent Masters in Cybersecurity graduate with a profound interest in Governance, Risk, and Compliance, dedicated to ensuring safety of information and systems. 

## Objective
My journey in Cybersecurity has led me to develop a passion for discovering and eliminating risk, and now I am dedicated to learning tools and frameworks that help attain this goal. I am eager to transition into this field, specifically Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) as an entry level analyst. 
I have created a fictional company, FIRST CARE CORP, to be used in the projects.
